# online-tests
Some solutions for online tests that I did. Please just remember that the most important thing here is to complete the tests in a fraction of the time and not create a good design solution. By the way, I believe the HackerRank tests are not the best way to measure knowledge. First, because you can get help from others. Second, if not, sometimes it's better to take some time thinking in a better solution than just to start coding.
